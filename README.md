* Real-time server metrics.
* One click access to various tools (Nginx VTS, phpMyAdmin, Adminer, phpRedisAdmin,... that can be installed with `wo stack install` command)
* Beautiful graph and gauge.
* Fast and clean.

## Usage

### Automatic

```bash
wo stack install --dashboard
wo stack install --netdata
```

### Manual

Download and extract the archive in a directory :

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/WordOps/wordops-dashboard/releases/download/v1.2/wordops-dashboard.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /path/you/want
```

Replace in the following line `/netdata/` with the full and public address of your netdata instance :

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/netdata/dashboard.js"></script>
```

## Troubleshooting

**Network interfaces meter are not displayed on the dashboard**

If you network interface isn't named `eth0`, you just have to use the command `ifconfig` to find its name and to replace `eth0` with the proper interface name in the dashboard index.php file. Example for a network interface named `ens18`:

```bash
sed -i 's/eth0/ens18/' /var/www/22222/htdocs/index.php
```

## Build

The dashboard contains minified CSS, JS files that generated by Gulp build process. It's required to install Nodejs, Gulp and require package to build your own new CSS, JS files.

```bash
npm install # for the first time
gulp # or
gulp css # or
gulp js
```
